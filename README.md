## Face-Mask Detector
Real time face-mask detection using Machine Learning and OpenCV

## About Project
Today it has become mandatory for all the citizens to wear a face mask to protect themselves . This application can be helpful for all the shop owners, offices, banks or any public place because if anyone is not wearing a mask then he or she must not be allowed in that area. So, to take care of this problem we donâ€™t need any guard or person who keeps a watch on people. We can integrate a camera which continuously clicks pictures of humans and detect from there faces whether they are wearing a face mask or not.

**The model is capable of predicting multiple faces with or without masks at the same time**

## Required to Learn for the Project
**Image Processing**

 Steps to perform image Processing:
     :Load images using Python or any other Programming
     :Convert images into aaray
     :After convertion of the images we can perform any algorithm on array we have
